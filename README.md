### Hi there! <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f636_200d_1f32b_fe0f/512.gif" alt="ðŸ˜¶" width="32" height="32">

I'm **Shruti**, a software developer based in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India.

I am passionate about building impactful solutions at the intersection of Web Development and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. I love creating modern, responsive web apps using React, Next.js, and Firebase. I'm also experienced in applying deep learning techniques, with a focus on sustainability and real-world applications. Currently exploring ways to integrate AI with clean, user-centric web platforms.

I enjoy book reading, [writing stuff](https://medium.com/@semwalshruti450), learning about new things, clicking [landscape photos](https://vsco.co/shrutisemwal/gallery), and editing them for fun.
